# iemhacks_Hackoz
The name of our team is Hackoz. 
Problem statement : Many communities face social challenges that require the collective efforts of volunteers to address. Developing a platform that connects individuals interested in volunteering with organizations and projects in need can help bridge the gap between those who want to help and those who need assistance. This can lead to positive social change and community development.
